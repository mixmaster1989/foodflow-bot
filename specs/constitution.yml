philosophy: "Spec-Driven Development. Quality first. Automated testing is mandatory for new features."

core_principles:
  - name: "I. Spec-Driven Development"
    description: |
      All features must start with specifications before implementation.
      Specifications define user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.
      No code is written without a spec that has been reviewed and approved.

  - name: "II. Quality First"
    description: |
      Code quality is non-negotiable. Automated testing is mandatory for all new features.
      Test-Driven Development (TDD) is preferred: write tests → get approval → tests fail → implement.
      Code reviews must verify test coverage and quality standards.

  - name: "III. Architecture Evolution"
    description: |
      Current: Monolithic Telegram Bot (SQLite)
      Target: Modular Monolith (PostgreSQL) → Microservices (when scale demands)
      Migration path must be documented and incremental.

  - name: "IV. Technology Stack Standards"
    description: |
      Backend: Python 3.10+, aiogram 3.x, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (Async)
      Database: PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development only)
      Caching: Redis (planned)
      Testing: pytest, pytest-asyncio
      CI/CD: GitHub Actions (planned)

  - name: "V. Observability & Monitoring"
    description: |
      Structured logging is mandatory (JSON format preferred).
      All external API calls must be logged with timing and error tracking.
      Critical paths must have metrics and alerting.

  - name: "VI. Security & Privacy"
    description: |
      No secrets in code or version control (.env files excluded via .gitignore).
      API keys managed via environment variables.
      User data privacy: minimal data collection, secure storage.

architecture_constraints:
  - "Monolithic structure is acceptable for current scale (<10k users)"
  - "Database migrations must be versioned and reversible"
  - "External API integrations must have fallback mechanisms"
  - "No breaking changes to Telegram Bot API without migration plan"

development_workflow:
  - "All features require spec → plan → tasks → implementation flow"
  - "PRs must include tests and pass CI checks"
  - "Code reviews verify spec compliance and test coverage"
  - "Technical debt items must be tracked in roadmap"

governance:
  - "Constitution supersedes all other practices"
  - "Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan"
  - "All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with constitution"
  - "Complexity must be justified; simpler alternatives preferred (YAGNI)"
